A             E
My Jesus, my Saviour,
F#m             E        D
Lord, there is none like You
           A    D	       A
All of my days, I want to praise,
		        G   Bm  E
The wonders of your mighty love

My comfort, my shelter,
Tower of refuge and strength
Let every breath, all that I am
Never cease to worship You

CHORUS:
A           F#m       	    D		     E
Shout to the Lord, all the earth let us sing,
A           F#m     D             E
Power and majesty, praise to the King
F#m      			   D
Mountains bow down and the seas will roar, 
       E	  F#m    E
At the sound of your name

A	      F#m    	D           E
I sing for joy at the work of your hands
A               F#m     D           E
Forever I'll love you, forever I'll stand
A          F#m          D             E     A
Nothing compares to the promise I have in You
