Song lyrics 
An image flashed across my TV screen
Another broken heart comes in to view
I saw the pain and I turned my back
Why can't I do the things I want to?
I'm willing yet I'm so afraid
You give me strength
When I say

CHORUS
I want to be your hands
I want to be your feet
I'll go where you send me
I'll go where you send me

REPEAT CHORUS

And I'll try, yeah I'll try
To touch the world like You touched my life
And I'll find my way
To be your hands

I'll abandon every selfish thought
I'll surrender every thing I've got
You can have everything I am
And perfect everything I'm not
I'm willing, I'm not afraid
You give me strength
When I say

CHORUS 2X

And I'll try, yeah I'll try
To touch the world like You touched my life
And I'll find my way...

BRIDGE
This is the last time
I turn my back on You
From now on, I'll go out
Send me where You want me to
I finally have a mission
I promise I'll complete
I don't need excuses
When I am your hands and feet
(I am your hands and feet)
(hands...4x)
(feet...4x)
(go...4x)
(go...4x)

CHORUS 3X

I will go
I will go where you send me
I will go
I will go where you send me
I will go, go
I will go, go
I will go, go where you send me

CHORUS
