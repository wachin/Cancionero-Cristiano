Friends 2003
Packing up the dreams 
God planted
In the fertile soil of you
I can't believe the hopes He's granted
Means a chapter in your life is through

We'll keep you close as always
It won't even seem you've gone
Cause our hearts in big and small ways
Will keep the love that keeps us strong


CHORUS
And friends are friends forever
If the Lord's the Lord of them
And a friend will not say "never"
Cause the welcome will not end
Though it's hard to let you go
In the Father's hands we know
That a lifetime's not too long to live as friends


With the faith and love that God's given
Springing from the hope we know
We will pray the joy you'll live in
Is the strength that now you show


But we'll keep you close as always
It won't even seem you've gone
Cause our hearts in big and small ways
Will keep the love that keeps us strong


CHORUS 2X
