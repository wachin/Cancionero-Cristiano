                  When the music fades
                  All is stripped away
                  And I simply come
                  Longing just to bring
                  Something that's of worth
                  That will bless Your heart
                  I'll bring You more than a song
                  For a song in itself
                  Is not what You have required
                  You search much deeper within
                  Through the way things appear
                  You're looking into my heart
                  I'm coming back to the heart of worship
                  And it's all about You,
                  It's all about You, Jesus
                  I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it
                  When it's all about You,
                  It's all about You, Jesus
                  King of endless worth
                  No one could express
                  How much You deserve
                  Though I'm weak and poor
                  All I have is Yours
                  Every single breath
                  I'll bring You more than a song
                  For a song in itself
                  Is not what You have required
                  You search much deeper within
                  Through the way things appear
                  You're looking into my heart
                  I'm coming back to the heart of worship
                  And it's all about You, 
                  It's all about You, Jesus
                  I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it
                  And it's all about You, 
                  It's all about You, Jesus
                  I'm coming back to the heart of worship,
                  And it's all about You,
                  It's all about You, Jesus
                  I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it
                  And it's all about You,
                  It's all about You, Jesus
