                  Navigation: M \ Michael W. Smith \ Somewhere Somehow
                  Standing in our silence
                  I hear my heart beating
                  And if only I could choose
                  I’d stay here with you
                  But hold me ’til the train is leaving
                  Somewhere down the line
                  After you’re gone from sight
                  Our love will be the same
                  And, whispering your name,
                  I’ll cling to you with all my might
                  Let me dream of you
                  But it’s true
                  And wake me up when this is over
                  Love will be there when this is over and
                  CHORUS:
                  Somewhere far beyond today
                  I will find a way to find you
                  And somehow thru the lonely nights
                  I will leave a light in the dark
                  Let it lead you to my heart
                  There’s a love inside us
                  Deep down inside
                  That goes without saying
                  Don’t say a word
                  But I’ll tell you just the same
                  And that love will fan the flame
                  And that flame will warm the heart that’s waiting
                  You are mine and I’ll wait for you my love
                  You are mine it may take some time
                  Even if it takes a lifetime
                  Tell me you’ll wait
                  CHORUS
                  BRIDGE:
                  And somewhere alone
                  I will be praying you home
                  I know that somehow our love
                  Our love will lead me to your arms
                  CHORUS
