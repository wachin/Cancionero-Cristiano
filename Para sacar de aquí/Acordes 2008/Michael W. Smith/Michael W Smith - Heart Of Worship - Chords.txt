    Note:
  When playing D/F#, you could play D


  VERSE1
   D               A                         Em7                A
  When the music fades, and all is stripped away, and I simply come  
  D                A                       Em7                           
 Longing just to bring something that's of worth that'll bless You 
  A                                            
heart                                     PRE CHORUS
        Em7                        D/F#                 A
       I'll bring You more than a song, for a song in itself
       Em7                      D/F#    A  Em7  (hold Em7)
       It's not what You have required 
                                D/F#                             D
       You search much deeper within, through the ways things appear 
       Em7                   A
       Your looking into my heart
                                            CHORUS
       D                       A         E   
      I'm coming back to the Heart of worship
      Em7                D    G                   A
      And its all about You, its all about You, Jesus
       D                       A                  G
      I'm sorry Lord for the things I've made of it 
      Em7                 D    G                  A
      When its all about You, its all about You Jesus 
                                             VERSE2
       D                A                  Em7                       A
      King of endless worth, no one could express, just how much You deserve
        E                  A                   Em7                  A
      Though I'm weak and poor, all I have is Yours, every single breath

       PLAY  PRE CHORUS AND CHORUS
                                   Bridge
       Em7           A   G             A
      its all about You, its all about You   (repeat1)

   That's it. EASY song.
