Song lyrics 
I can only imagine what it will be like 
When I walk by your side 
I can only imagine what my eyes will see 
When your face is before me 
I can only imagine 
I can only imagine 

Surrounded by your glory 
What will my heart feel? 
Will I dance for you Jesus? 
Or in awe of you be still? 
Will I stand in your presence? 
Or to my knees will I fall? 
Will I sing Halelluja? 
Will I be able to speak at all? 
I can only imagine 
I can only imagine 

I can only imagine when that day comes 
And I find myself standing in the Son 
I can only imagine when all I will do 
Is forever, forever worship you 
I can only imagine 
I can only imagine 

Surrounded by your glory 
What will my heart feel? 
Will I dance for you Jesus? 
Or in awe of you be still? 
Will I stand in your presence? 
Or to my knees will I fall? 
Will I sing Halelluja? 
Will I be able to speak at all? 
I can only imagine, yeah 
I can only imagine 
I can only imagine, yeah, yeah, yeah 

Surrounded by your glory 
What will my heart feel? 
Will I dance for you Jesus? 
Or in awe of you be still? 
Will I stand in your presence? 
Or to my knees will I fall? 
Will I sing Halelluja? 
Will I be able to speak at all? 
I can only imagine, yeah 

I can only imagine, yeah, yeah 
I can only imagine, Yeah 
I can only imagine 
I can only imagine, Ohh yeah 
I can only imagine 

I can only imagine when all I will do 
is forever, forever worship you 
I can only imagine
