                  Open the eyes of my heart, Lord
                  Open the eyes of my heart
                  I want to see You
                  I want to see You
                  Open the eyes of my heart, Lord
                  Open the eyes of my heart
                  I want to see You
                  I want to see You
                  To see You high and lifted up
                  Shinin' in the light of Your glory
                  Pour out Your power and love
                  As we sing holy, holy, holy
                  Open the eyes of my heart, Lord
                  Open the eyes of my heart
                  I want to see You
                  I want to see You
                  Open the eyes of my heart, Lord
                  Open the eyes of my heart
                  I want to see You
                  I want to see You
                  To see You high and lifted up
                  Shinin' in the light of Your glory
                  Pour out Your power and love
                  As we sing holy, holy, holy
