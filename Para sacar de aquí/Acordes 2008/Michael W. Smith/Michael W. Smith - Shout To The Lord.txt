Shout To The Lord 
http://www.lyricstime.com/michael-w-smith-shout-to-the-lord-lyrics.html

My Jesus, my Savior, 
Lord, there is none like You; 
All of my days, I want to praise, 
The wonders of Your mighty love.

My comfort, my shelter, Tower of refuge and strength; 
Let every breath, all that I am 
Never cease to worship You. 

Shout to the Lord, all the earth 
Let us sing power and majesty, praise to the King; 
Mountains bow down and the seas will roar, 
At the sound of your name 

I sing for joy at the work of your hands 
Forever I'll love you, forever I'll stand 
Nothing compares to the promise I have in You
