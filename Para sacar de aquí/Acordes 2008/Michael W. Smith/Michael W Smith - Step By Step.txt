Song lyrics
Oh God, You are my God 
And I will ever praise You 

Oh God, You are my God 
And I will ever praise You 

I will seek You in the morning 
And I will learn to walk in Your ways 
And Step by step You'll lead me 
And I will follow You all of my days :|| 
And I will follow You all of my days 

Hallelujah! 
We honor you Lord, Jesus! 
And forever we will sing 
Hallelujah! 
For you alone are worthy 
And forever we will sing 
Hallelujah! 
Hallelujah! 
Hallelujah! 
Hallelujah!
