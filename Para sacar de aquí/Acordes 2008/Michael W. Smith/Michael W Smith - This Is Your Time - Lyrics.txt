This Is Your Time
It was a test we could all hope to pass
But none of us would want to take
Faced with the choice to deny God and live
For her there was one choice to make

This was her time
This was her dance
She lived every moment
Left nothing to chance
She swam in the sea
Drank of the deep
Embraced the mystery
Of all she could be
This was her time


Though you are mourning, and grieving your loss,
Death died a long time ago
Swallowed in life, so her life carries on
Still, it's so hard to let go


This was her time
This was her dance
She lived every moment
Left nothing to chance
She swam in the sea
Drank of the deep
Embraced the mystery
Of all she could be
What if tomorrow
What if today
Faced with the question
Oh, what would you say


This is your time
This is your dance
Live every moment
Leave nothing to chance
Swim in the sea
Drink of the deep
And fall on the mercy
And hear yourself praying
Won't you save me
Won't you save me


This is your time
This is your dance
Live every moment
Leave nothing to chance
Swim in the sea
Drink of the deep
Embrace the mystery of all you can be


(Repeat)
This is your time
