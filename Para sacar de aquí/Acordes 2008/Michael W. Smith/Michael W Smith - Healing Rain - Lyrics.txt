                  Navigation: M \ Michael W. Smith \ Healing Rain
                  Healing rain is coming down 
                  It's coming nearer to this old town 
                  Rich and poor, weak and strong 
                  It's bringing mercy, it won't be long 
                  Healing rain is coming down 
                  It's coming closer to the lost and found 
                  Tears of joy, and tears of shame 
                  Are washed forever in Jesus' name 
                  Healing rain, it comes with fire 
                  So let it fall and take us higher 
                  Healing rain, I'm not afraid 
                  To be washed in Heaven's rain 
                  Lift your heads, let us return 
                  To the mercy seat where time began 
                  And in your eyes, I see the pain 
                  Come soak this dry heart with healing rain 
                  And only You, the Son of man 
                  Can take a leper and let him stand 
                  So lift your hands, they can be held 
                  By someone greater, the great I Am 
                  Healing rain, it comes with fire 
                  So let it fall and take us higher 
                  Healing rain, I'm not afraid 
                  To be washed in Heaven's rain 
                  To be washed in Heaven's rain... 
                  Healing rain is falling down 
                  Healing rain is falling down 
                  I'm not afraid 
                  I'm not afraid...
