      Em7                 D    G                  A

      King of endless worth, no one could express, just how much You deserve
        E                  A                   Em7                  A
      Though I'm weak and poor, all I have is Yours, every single breath

       PLAY  PRE CHORUS AND CHORUS
                                   Bridge
       Em7           A   G             A

   That's it. EASY song.
