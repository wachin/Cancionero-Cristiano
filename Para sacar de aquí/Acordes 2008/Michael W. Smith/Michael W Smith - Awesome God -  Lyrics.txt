                  Navigation: M \ Michael W. Smith \ Awesome God
                  When He rolls up His sleeves
                  He ain't just puttin' on the Ritz
                  (our God is an Awesome God)
                  There is thunder in His footsteps
                  And lightning in His fists
                  (our God is an Awesome God)
                  Well the Lord He wasn't jokin'
                  when He kicked 'em out of Eden
                  It wasn't for no reason that He shed His blood
                  His return is very close and so you better be believin'
                  That our God is an Awesome God
                  REFRAIN
                  Our God (our god) is an Awesome God
                  He Reigns (he reigns) from heaven above
                  With Wisdom (with wisdom)pow'r and love
                  Our God is an Awesome God
                  When the sky was starless in the void of the night
                  (our god is an awesome god)
                  He spoke into the darkness and created the light
                  (our god is an awesome god)
                  Judgement and wrath He poured out the Sodom
                  Mercy and grace He gave us at the cross
                  I hope that we have not too quickly forgotten that
                  Our God is an Awesome God
                  REFRAIN x 3
