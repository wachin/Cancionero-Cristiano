In The Secret - Guitar Chords
G              D            C
In the secret, in the quiet place
Em               D       C
In the stillness You are there
G              D            C
In the secret, in the quiet hour I wait, only for You,
Em               D        C
'Cause I want to know You more

G         D
I want to know You
Em        C
I want to hear Your voice
G         D         C
I want to know Your more
G         D
I want to touch You
Em        C
I want to see Your face
G         D        C  G
I want to know You more

G             D              C
I am reaching for the higest goal
Em             D         C
That I might receive the prize
G                D             C
Pressing onward, pushing every hindrance aside, out of my way
Em               D        C
'Cause I want to know You more
