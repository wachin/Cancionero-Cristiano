Song lyrics
Majesty
Worship His majesty
Unto Jesus, be all glory
Honor, and praise

Majesty
Kingdom authority
Flow from His throne
Unto His own
His anthem raise

Majesty
Worship His majesty
Unto Jesus, be all glory
Honor, and praise

Majesty
Kingdom authority
Flow from His throne
Unto His own
His anthem raise

So exalt, lift up on high
The name of Jesus
Magnify, come glorify
Christ Jesus the King

Majesty
Worship His majesty
Jesus who died, now glorified
King of all Kings

So exalt, lift up on high
The name of Jesus
Magnify, come glorify
Christ Jesus the King

Majesty
Worship His majesty
Jesus who died, now glorified
King of all Kings
