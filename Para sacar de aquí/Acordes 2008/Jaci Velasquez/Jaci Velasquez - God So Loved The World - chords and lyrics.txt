Chorus:
God so loved the world
That He gave His one and only Son
That whosoever believes in Him
will not perish but have everlasting life

I try so hard to find the words to say
To let you know how great is this God to whom I pray
Nothing can or ever will compare
To the peace that flows in your soul when He is living there

Oh I know you've been through so much
It's hard to contemplate letting go and reaching out in trust
But I know the simple truth
That love is here for you
So take Him at His word and see what He can do

The promise is yours and mine
Take hold of this love
For the rest of your life

But it's time to take a step of faith
Be prepared for Jesus' love to carry you away.
