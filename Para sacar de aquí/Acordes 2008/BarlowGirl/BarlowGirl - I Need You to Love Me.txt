Song lyrics 
Why, why are You still here with me, 
Didn't You see what I've done? 
In my shame I want to run 
And hide myself there 
But its here I see the truth 
I don't deserve You 

But I need You to love me, 
And I, I won't keep my heart from You this time 
And I'll stop this pretending that I can 
Somehow deserve what I already have 
I need You to love me 

I, I have wasted so much time 
Pushing You away from me 
I just never saw how You could cherish me 
Cuz You're a God who has all things 
And still You want me 

And I need You to love me, 
And I, I won't keep my heart from You this time 
And I'll stop this pretending that I can 
Somehow deserve what I already have 
I need You to love me 

Your love makes me forget what I have been 
Your love makes me see who I really am 
Your love makes me forget what I have been 
Oh, oh 

And I need You to love me, yeah 
I need You to love me, yea-ee-yea 
And I'll stop this pretending that I can 
Somehow deserve what I already have 
Somehow deserve what I already have 
I need You to love me...yeah 
I need you to... 
Oh, oh... oh, oh... (repeat 3x) 
Love me...love me...(fade)
