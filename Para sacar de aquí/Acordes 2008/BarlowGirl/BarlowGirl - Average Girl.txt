Song lyrics
So what I'm not your average girl
I don't meet the standards of this world
Chasing after boys is not my thing
See I'm waiting for a wedding ring

No more dating
I'm just waiting
Like sleeping beauty
My prince will come for me
No more dating
I'm just waiting
'Cause God is writing my love story

Boys are bad that's certainly not true
'Cause God is preparing one for you
If you get tired waiting till he comes
God's arms are the perfect place to run

Sleep that's the only thing For me 
'Cause when I sleep God's preparing one 
for me
