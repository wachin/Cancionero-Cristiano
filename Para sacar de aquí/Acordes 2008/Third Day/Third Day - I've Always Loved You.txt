      Verse 1: 
      I don't know how to explain it but I know that words would hardly do. 
      Miracles and signs and wonders aren't enough for me to convince you. 
      Chorus: 
      Don't you know I've always loved you 
      Even before there was Time 
      Though you turn away I tell you still 
      Don't you know I've always loved you and I always will. 
      Verse 2:
      Greater love has not a man than the one who gives his life to prove
      That he would do anything and that's what I'm going to do for you
