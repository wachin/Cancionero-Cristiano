      Set this place on fire
      E             G       A
      Send your Spirit, Savior
      E         G           A
      Rescue from the mire
      E              G         A
      Show your servant favor
      *Pre-Chorus:
      A                                     G
      Yesterday was the day that I was alone
      D                               B7
      Now I'm in the presence of Almighty God
      *Chorus:
      E    C           G            D h  Dsus p D p Dsus4      
      Yes our God, He is a consuming fire
      E        C              A
      And the flames burn down deep in my soul
      E    C            G          D h Dsus p D p Dsus4
      Yes our God He is a consuming fire
      E             C              A

      Bm              D                A                      Em
      Did you ever realize that inside of there is a flame
      Bm        D                   A
      Did you ever try to let it burn (let it burn, let it burn)
      E    C          G             D
      And yes our God, He is a consuming fire
      E        C              A
      And the flames burn down deep in my soul
