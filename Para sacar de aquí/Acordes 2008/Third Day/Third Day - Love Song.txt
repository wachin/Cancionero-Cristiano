      Capo 3
      Em                       C 
      I've heard it said that a man would climb a mountain 
      D                   G      B7 
      just to be with the one he loves 
      Em                    C 
      how many times has he broken that promise 
      D                 G 
      it has never been done 
                 C                   G 
      I've never climbed the highest mountain 
            C                D 
      but I walked the hill of Calvary 
        G                              D 
      just to be with you I would do anything 
                C                 G   D 
      theres no price I would not pay 
      G                                D 
      just to be with you I would give everything 
              C            Em   D 
      I would give my life away 
        
      Em                       C 
      I've heard it said that a man would swim the ocean 
      D                   G      B7 
      just to be with the one he loves 
      Em                           C 
      well all those dreams are an empty emotion 
      D               G 
      it can never be done 
                   C                G 
      I've never swam the deepest ocean 
            C                      D 
      but I walked upon the raging sea 
        
      *bridge* 
            Bm                                 Em 
      and I know that you dont understand the fullness of my love 
            C                            G 
      how I died upon the cross for your sins 
            Bm                              Em 
      and I know that you dont realize how much I gave you 
            C                     D 
      and I promise Id do it all again 
        
      G                             D 
      just to be with you Ive done everything 
                 C               G  D 
      theres no price I did not pay 
      G                           D 
      just to be with you I gave everything 
            C            Em   D 
      yes I gave my life away 
                     Em   D 
      I gave my life away 
      G 
      just to be with you 
      C9      G 
      just to be with you
