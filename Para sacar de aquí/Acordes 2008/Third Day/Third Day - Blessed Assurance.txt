Title: Blessed Assurance
Artist: Third Day
Compilation Album: Next Door Savior(2003)
Creative Trust Records

I absolutely love this song. They play it on the radio in Atlanta all the time,
im so surprised that no one has already tabbed it out the way that Third Day
does. Anyway, here it goes!

This is the way I play my chords. Don't correct me if you don't play them like 
this. It will sound fine if you play the root chord too (shown in parenthesis):

G- 320033 (320003)
Cadd9- 032033 (032010)
Em7- 022033 (022000)
Asus4- x02233 (x02200)
D/F#- 200233 (xx0232)

CAPO 7

Intro:
G  Cadd9

Verses:
G  Cadd9  G
Em7  Asus4  D/F# 
(x2)

Chorus:
G  Cadd9  G
Em7  Asus4  D/F# 
G  Cadd9  G
Cadd9  D/F#  G

Thats pretty much it. It's a great song and I love playin it. Later peeps...
