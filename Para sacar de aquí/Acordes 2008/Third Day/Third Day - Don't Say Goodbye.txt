      CAPO 3RD 
      E                Esus              E       Esus
      Look outside the autumn leaves are falling
      E               Esus             E      Esus
      Deep inside you hear the road is calling
            A                Asus          A              Asus
      And I know you want to walk away and leave it all behind
                      E    Esus E Esus
      Running from my faith
      E                Esus               E    Esus
      Chasing lies can find you tired and jaded
      E                    Esus            E    Esus
      Check your world the colors have all faded
             A                 Asus             A                 Asus
      If you feel that you can run the place to get away from the pain
                     E    Esus E Esus F#m G# A
      Looking for my faith
      F#m    G#     A             D B
      I hate to see you leave without a fight
      E              F#m
      Time will open doors for you
          A                B
      The wishes that make dreams come true
        E               F#m                 B
      I promise I'll be there don't say goodbye
      E              F#m
      Time will open doors for you
      A                 B
      Wishes spent make dreams come true
        E               F#m                 B
      I promise I'll be there don't say goodbye
      E                  Esus           E    Esus
      Take my hand let's walk a while together
      E                   Esus             E   Esus
      Holding hands won't make it last forever
            A                 Asus            A                Asus
      But I know you probably need someone to help you work it out
                    E    Esus E Esus F#m G# A
      Got to do something
      F#m    G#     A             D B
      I hate to see you leave without a fight
