      Verse 1:
      A           E         F#m       F#m
      I've heard all those stories
      A          E       F#m       F#m
      I've seen all the signs
      A          E       F#m     F#m
      Witnessed all the glory
      A       E        F#m
      Tasted all thats fine
      Chorus:
                  A   E        F#m           D           A   E   F#m
      Nothing compares to the greatness of knowing You, Lord
                  A   E        F#m           D           A   E   F#m
      Nothing compares to the greatness of knowing You, Lord

      Verse 2:
      I see all the people
      Wasting all their time
      Building up their riches
      For a life that's fine
      Bridge:
         A               D          F#m   E
      I find myself just living for today
               A                 D              F#m   E
      'Cause I don't know what tomorrow's gonna bring
             A          D                  F#m               A5
      So no matter if I rise or fall, I'll never be alone, oh no
