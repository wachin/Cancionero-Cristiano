      [Verse 1]
      G                          C G                               C
        You can all call me crazy   for the things that I might say
      G                              F                              C |
        You can laugh all you want to  but I know there will come a day
      C                         G     C                            G
        When we all will come together  and learn to set aside our hates
      C                          G       F                             D
        We can learn to love our neighbor  just like will will love ourselves
      [Chorus]
                          Em7                 C2                     G
      We've got to come together cause in the end we can make it all right
                             Em7             C2         G
      We've got to brave the weather through all of the storms
                          Em7                 C2                     G
      We've got to come together cause in the end we can make it all right
                            Dsus/F  C2                      G   
      We've got to learn to love,     we've got to learn to love
      [Verse 2]
      G                           C G                               C
        You can call me a dreamer,   but these dreams will come true
      G                                     F                           C       
        And yes, I am a firm believer, yeah,  in the things that we can do
      C                            G     C                           G   
        If we will all just come together  and let the Lord lead our way
      C                          G            F                           D
        There is nothing that we can't do, no,  there is nothing we can't face
      [Bridge]
            C                                        G
      And I know that there will come a day when the Lord will call His own away
           C                                 D                        
      To a place that He has made for all of us
          C                                     Em
      But until the day of His return there's a lesson that we've got to learn
             C                                  D
      We are brothers and we're sisters, we are one
