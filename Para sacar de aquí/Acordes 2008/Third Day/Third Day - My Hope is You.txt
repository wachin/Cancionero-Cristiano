      A
      To You O' Lord I lift my soul
      In You O' God I place my trust
      Do not let me be put to shame
      Nor let my enemies triumph over me
      A
      My hope is You, Show me Your ways
                           F#m                     D
      Guide me in truth, In all my days
                           A
      My hope is you
      A
      I am O' Lord filled with Your love
      You are O' God my salvation
      Guard my life and rescue me
      My broken spirit shouts 
      my mended heart cries out
