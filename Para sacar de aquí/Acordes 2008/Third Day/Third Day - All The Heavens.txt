      Verse:
              C        G         Am
      As Your children gather in peace 
      Am Amin7 F Fmaj7 G         C
      All the  angels sing in heaven 
              C      G          Am   
      In Your temple all that I seek 
      Am Amin7 F      Fmaj7 G       C
      Is  to  glimpse Your  holy presence 
      Chorus:
              F                        C              
      All the heavens cannot hold You, Lord 
               F                G
      How much less to dwell in me? 
            F                 Am    F  Fmaj7 G     G7 C      
      I can only make my one desire Holding  on to Thee 
      Verse2: (same as verse 1)
      All the angels exalt You on high 
      What a kingdom to depart 
      But You left Your throne in the sky 
      Just to live inside my heart
