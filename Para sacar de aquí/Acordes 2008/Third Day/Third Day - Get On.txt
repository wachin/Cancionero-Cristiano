      So you think you had me, Had me in your sights?

      I got news for you, I'm workin' overtime.
      B                         D
      To get away from slander, to stay away from lies

      E5            D                   E5
      Trying to put down what I've been workin' on.
      B                           D
      So if you want to break me, you better stay away
      E5                         D             E5

      Give of me all of your intentions
      G                      D
      Well I've decided that I won't listen
      E                       F#
      Because your words only bring division
