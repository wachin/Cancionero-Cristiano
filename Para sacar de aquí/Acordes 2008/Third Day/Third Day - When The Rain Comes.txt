            back to guitar chords

      Capo 1
      G       D/F#    Em      G/D       C       G/B     Am      D
      When the rain comes it seems that everyone has gone away
      G       D/F#    Em      G/D       C       G/B     Am      D
      When the night falls you wonder if you shouldn't find someplace
      Am         D9/F#  Am            D9/F#
      To run and hide,   escape the pain
          Am       G      D/F#   Am       D Dsus D
      But hiding's such a lonely thing to do
      [Chorus]
      G       D/F#     Em
      I can't stop the rain
           C               D
      From falling down on you again
      G       D/F#     Em
      I can't stop the rain
          C               D                 G D/F# Em C D
      But I will hold you 'til it goes away
      [Verse 2]
      When the rain comes you blame it on the things that you have done
      When the storm fades you know that rain must fall on everyone
      Rest awhile.  It'll be alright
      No one loves you like I do
      [Outro - play verse tab]
      When the rain comes 
             D Dsus  G
      I will hold    you
