      Verse 1
      E
      Blackbird, why you wearin' that frown?
                                     A                          A/G
      Well, don't ya know Jesus loves you and me

      and the preacher on TV your puttin' down?
      E
      Blackbird, how I love you to hear your songs.
                                   A                         A/G
      Well, I could spend all my time in the shade of a tree
      And listen all day long.
      A-G-E
                Whoa yeah
      A-G-E
                I could listen
      A-G-E
                 All day long
      A-G-E
      Chorus:
                              G                          D
      Whoa but your ever hearing, never understanding
                A                                                E
      Yea I see you're not percieving and your heart has grown
      calloused
      G                              D
      You're in a storm and lost your way,
                      A
      Won't you fly to heaven and be saved today.

      Verse 2:
      E
      Blackbird, now you've broken your wings.
                           A
      You try to fly high, but you know that
              A/G
      You can't go anywhere, you can't do anything.
      E
      Blackbird, who put you in your cage?
                             A
      Tell me was it God or was it you
                   A/G
      Or was it me, well I guess it don't matter anyway.
      A-G-E
                Whoa no no
      A-G-E
                It don't matter
      A-G-E
                No no anyway
      A-G-E
      Chorus:
      E-A
             Whoa yeah
      E-A           E-A

      *Guitar Solo*
      A-G-E x 5
      GA
      A-G-E
      A-G-E
      You say you need a remedy,
      For the thorn in your pride
                                        A
      I think it's such a tragedy
                     A    G       E
      That you left Him behind!
      You say you light your candle
      But your love light doesn't shine.
                                       A
      You say you talk to angels
                A               G      E
      Well, I say that's such a lie.
      A-G-E
                Yes it is now
      A-G-E              A-G-E
               such a lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie.
