Song lyrics 
Hold the milk, put back the sugar 
They are powerless to console 
We've gathered here to sprinkle ashes 
from our late friend's cereal bowl. 
Breakfast Clubbers, say the motto 
that he taught us to repeat: 
"You will lose it in your gym class 
if you wait `til noon to eat." 

Back when the Chess Club said our eggs were soft 
every Monday he'd say grace and hold our juice aloft 
Oh, none of us knew his checkout time would come so soon 
But before his brain stopped waving, he composed this tune: 

Chorus 
WHEN THE TOAST IS BURNED 
AND ALL THE MILK HAS TURNED 
AND CAPTAIN CRUNCH IS WAVING FAREWELL 
WHEN THE BIG ONE FINDS YOU 
MAY THIS SONG REMIND YOU 
THAT THEY DON'T SERVE BREAKFAST IN HELL 

Breakfast clubbers, drop the hankies. 
Though to some our friend was odd, 
that day he bought those pine pajamas 
his check was good with God. 

Those here without the Lord, 
how do you cope? 
For this morning we don't mourn 
like those who have no hope 

Oh, rise up, Fruit Loop lovers - 
sing out sweet & low 
With spoons held high 
we bid our brother, "Cheerio!"
