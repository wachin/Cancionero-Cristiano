Song lyrics 
You don't understand
This is not what you think it is
You don't get it man
You want to boil it down to show biz
Your in-depth research shows
Drop the God, emphasize the beat
I've heard that positive pop you dig
I'd rather be buried in wet concrete

Take back your free advice
I don't accept
I will not play those games
God is not a secret to be kept
God is not a secret to be kept

You don't understand
I'm not talking multiple choice
You don't get it man
If the cries offend you, find another voice
I am not running for office here
I won't keep purposefully vague
I've heard New Age Life-force trip
I'd rather be dipped in bubonic plague

Take back your free advice
I don't accept
I will not play those games
God is not a secret to be kept
God is not a secret to be kept

If we keep silent
If we mass defect
These very rocks will scream
God is not a secret to be kept
God is not a secret to be kept
