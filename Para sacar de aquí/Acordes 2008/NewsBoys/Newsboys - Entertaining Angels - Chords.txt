Entertaining Angels - Guitar Chords
A    Bm G                           A
One to another, do you remember me?
   Em      G
I feel so small, well are you listening tonight?
A   Bm    G                                A
So temporary, the things that I have seen. 
   Em     G
I ran so far, would you take me back again? 


D                           Bm          G
Entertaining Angels by the light of my T.V. screen
D                   Bm     G
24-7, you wait for me. 
D                           Bm          G
Entertaining Angels by the time I fall to my knees.

Hosts of Heaven sing over me. 


D    Bm  G                           A
One to another, feelings in between
  Em        G                                  A
I won't let go, all you taught me...all right
 Bm     G                             A
Close as a brother, the way we used to be
      Em         G
I'll hold my breath, and wait for you to breathe


D                           Bm          G
Entertaining Angels by the light of my T.V. screen

24-7 you wait for me.
D                              Bm            G
Entertaining Angels while the night becomes history

Hosts of heaven sing over me
