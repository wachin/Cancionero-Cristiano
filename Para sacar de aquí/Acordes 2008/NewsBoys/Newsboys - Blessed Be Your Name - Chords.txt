Blessed Be Your Name - Guitar Chords
G       D                     Em          C
Blessed be your name, in the land that is plentiful
      G               D
Where streams of abundance flow
C
Blessed be your name
G        D                      Em            C
Blessed be your name, when I'm found in this desert place
          G                 D
Though I walk through the wilderness
C
Blessed be your name

G               D
Every blessing you pour out I
Em             C
Turn back to praise
G                      D
And when the darkness closes in Lord,
Em            D
Still I will say...

                G               D
Blessed be the name of the Lord
                 Em  C
Blessed be your name
                G               D
Blessed be the name of the Lord
                 Em        C
Blessed be your glorious name

G       D                       Em             C
Blessed be your name, when the sun's shining down on me
          G               D
When the world is all as it should be,
C
Blessed be your name
G       D                     Em               C
Blessed be your name, on the road marked with suffering,
                G               D
Though there is pain in the offering,
C
Blessed be your name

    G               D
You give and take away
     Em             D
You give and take away
     G                   D
My heart will choose to say
       G                C
Lord, blessed be your name
