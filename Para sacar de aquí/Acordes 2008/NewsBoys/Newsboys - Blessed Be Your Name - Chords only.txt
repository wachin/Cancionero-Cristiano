                        It's on a very good CD by Newsboys called Devotion. They 
                        did their own version of it.

                        umm thats right but i personally think that tree63s 
                        version is better
                        KEEP ON ROCKIN AS MUCH AS JESUS ROCKS

                        It has been recorded by at least ten groups and it was 
                        written by Beth and Matt Reddman, as so many of the 
                        other songs we worship our Lord with.

                        The chords are fine even if you have to change the key 
                        this is how i play it and it works al the same. And if 
                        there is something wrong with it post another tab. and 
                        dont complain about it. that goes for all the other tabs 
                        too.
