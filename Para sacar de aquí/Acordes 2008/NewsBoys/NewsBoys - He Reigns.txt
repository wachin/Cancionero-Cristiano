(Repeat same chords)
let it rise above the four winds
caught up in the heavenly sound
let praises echo from the towers of cathedrals
to the faithful gathered underground
of all the songs sung from the dawn of creation
some were meant to persist
of all the bells rung from a thousand steeples
none rings truer than this

- Chorus -
all God's children singing
glory, glory, hallelujah, He reigns
He reigns, He reigns
all God's children singing
glory, glory, hallelujah, He reigns
He reigns, He reigns

Bridge
and all the powers of darkness
tremble at what they've just heard
'cause all the powers of darkness
can't drown out a single word

when all God's children sing out
glory, glory, hallelujah, He reigns
He reigns, He reigns
all God's children sing out
glory, glory, hallelujah, He reigns
He Reigns, He reigns
