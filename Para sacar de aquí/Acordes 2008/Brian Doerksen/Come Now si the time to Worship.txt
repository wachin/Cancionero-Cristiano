Come Now Is The Time To Worship lyrics

Come, now is the time to worship
Come, now is the time to give your heart
Come, just as you are to worship
Come, just as you are before your God
Come

(Spoken: One day)
One day ev'ry tongue will confess You are God


One day ev'ry knee will bow
Still the greatest treasure remains for those
Who gladly choose You now

(Spoken: Come)
Come, now is the time to worship
Come, now is the time to give your heart
Come, just as you are to worship
Come, just as you are before your God
Come

(Spoken: One day)
One day ev'ry tongue will confess You are God

One day ev'ry knee will bow
Still the greatest treasure remains for those
Who gladly choose You now

Ooh, we're calling You
Calling all nations
Now is the time
One day ev'ry tongue will confess You are God
One day ev'ry knee will bow
Still the greatest treasure remains for those
Who gladly choose You now

(Spoken: One day)
One day ev'ry tongue will confess You are God
One day ev're knee will bow
Still the greatest treasure remains for those
Who gladly choose You now
