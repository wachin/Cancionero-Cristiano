Lord I Lift Your Name On High - Guitar Chords
G       C                 D    C
Lord, I lift Your name on high
G       C                 D       C
Lord, I love to sing Your praises
G      C                 D     C
I'm so glad You're in my life
G      C                D     C
I'm so glad You came to save us

G             C         D        C        G
You came from heaven to earth to show the way,
         G            D         C       G
From the earth to the cross, my debt to pay,
         C            D               Em           Am
From the cross to the grave, from the grave to the sky,
        D                 G
Lord, I lift Your name on high
