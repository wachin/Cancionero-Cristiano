Intro: F  Bb 
 
       F                                 Bb 
You're in a better place, I've heard a thousand times 
        F                              Bb 
And at least a thousand times I've rejoiced for you 
         Eb                        C 
But the reason why I'm broken, the reason why I cry 
    F        Bb         C             F
Is how long must I wait to be with you 
 
F                      Bb
I close my eyes and I see your face 
       C                          Dm
If home's where my heart is then I'm out of place 
                Bb                  C                    F
Lord, won't you give me strength to make it through somehow 
      C               Bb             F
I've never been more homesick than now
  
 F  Bb 
  
F                                  Bb
Help me Lord cause I don't understand your ways 
     F                            Bb
The reason why, I wonder if I'll ever know 
      Eb                               C 
But, even if you showed me, the hurt would be the same 
      F       Bb             C           F
Cause I'm still here so far away from home 
  
F                      Bb
I close my eyes and I see your face 
       C                          Dm
If home's where my heart is then I'm out of place 
                Bb                  C                    F
Lord, won't you give me strength to make it through somehow 
      C               Bb             F
I've never been more homesick than now
 
     F                      Bb
In Christ, there are no goodbyes 
        F                    Bb 
And in Christ, there is no end 
         Eb                    C
So I'll hold onto Jesus with all that I have 
   F         Bb     C            F 
To see you again, to see you again 
  
Last Chorus: 
C                      Bb
I close my eyes and I see your face 
   C                              Bb
If home's where my heart is then I'm out of place 
                C                                  Bb
Lord, won't you give me strength to make it through somehow 
           C                                 Bb
Won't you give me strength to make it through somehow 
               C                                    Bb
Lord, won't you give me strength to make it through somehow 
    G         C                     F 
I've never been more homesick than now
