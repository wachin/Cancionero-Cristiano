Tune down 1/2 step!

-----------------------------------

Intro:

Em - C - Em - G - D - Bm - Am (2x)

Verse:

Em - G - D - Bm - C - Am - B7
Em - G - D - Bm - C - B7 - Em

Chorus:

G - D - Bm - C - Am - B7
G - D - Bm - C - B7 - Em

Bridge:

Em - D - C - Am (3x)

The last time you play the chorus' last Em, 
pick the chord from low E to high E then strum up-ward.

Enjoy!
