Verse:
   B                F#m
I long for your embrace
A              E
Every single day
   B                  F#m
To meet You in this place
    A                E
And see You face to face
            B    F#m
Will You show me
    A                E
Reveal Yourself to me
                  B     F#m
Because of Your mercy
     A             E
I fall down on my knees


Chorus:
                 B                 F#m
I can feel Your presence here with me
              A                  E
Suddenly I'm lost within Your beauty
                 B                 F#m
Caught up in the wonder of Your touch
              A             E
Here in this moment I surrender to Your love


Break:  B - F#m - A - E


2nd Verse:
       B            F#m
You're everywhere I go
A           E
I am not alone
     B               F#m
You call me as Your own
   A                 E
To know You and be known
         B     F#m
You are holy
        A               E
And I fall down on my knees
