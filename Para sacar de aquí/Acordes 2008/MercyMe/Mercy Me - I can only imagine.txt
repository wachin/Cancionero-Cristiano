I can only imagine 
Mercy Me


I can only imagine 
what it will be like
When I walk by Your side
I can only imagine
what my eyes will see
When Your face is before me
I can only imagine
I can only imagine

(Chorus next) 
Surrounded by Your glory
What will my heart feel?
Will I dance for You Jesus?
Or in awe of You be still?
Will I stand in Your presence?
Or to my knees will I fall?
Will I sing hallelujah?
Will I be able to speak at all?
I can only imagine
I can only imagine

I can only imagine when that day comes
And I find myself standing in the Son
I can only imagine
when all I will do Is forever,
forever worship You
I can only imagine
I can only imagine

(chorus 2x)(ad-lib) 

I can only imagine When all I will do Is forever, forever worship You I can only imagine.
