Lord i lift your name on high.
Lord i love to sing your praises
Im  so glad your in my life 
Im so glad you came to save us.


You came from heaven to earth, to show the way, 
from the earth to the cross, my debt to pay
from the cross to the grave
from the grave to the sky
Lord i lift your name on high.
