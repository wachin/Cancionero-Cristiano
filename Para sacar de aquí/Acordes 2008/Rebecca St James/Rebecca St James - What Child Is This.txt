Song lyrics 
 What child is this, who, laid to rest
On Mary's lap was sleeping
Whom angles greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping

This, this is Christ the king
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring him laud (I don't know what this is!)
The babe the son of Mary

Why lies He in such mean estate
Where ox and lamb are feeding
Good Christian, fear; For sinners here
The silent word is pleading

This, this is Christ the king
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring Him laud
The babe the son of Mary

So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh
Come peasant, king, to own Him
The king of kings salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone Him

This, this is Christ the king
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring Him laud
The babe the son of Mary

This, this is Christ the king
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring Him laud
The babe the son of Mary
The babe the son of Mary
