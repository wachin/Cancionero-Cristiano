Song lyrics
Darling did you know that I, I dream about you,
Waiting for the look in your eyes when we meet for the first time
And Darling did you know that I, I pray about you,
Praying that you will hold on
Keep your loving eyes only for me

Chorus:
Because I am waiting for, praying for you, Darling  
Wait for me too, wait for me as I wait for you
Because I am waiting for, praying for you, Darling
Wait for me too, wait for me as I wait for you
(Darling wait, Darling Wait)

Darling did you know I dream about life together
Knowing you will be forever.
I'll be yours and you'll be mine.
And Darling when I say, "till death do us part",
I'll mean it with all of my heart, now and always faithful to you

Repeat Chorus

Bridge:  
Now I know you may have made mistakes,
But there's forgiveness and a second chance.
So wait for me, Darling wait for me, wait for me, wait for me

Repeat Chorus

Wait for me, Darling Wait 
Because im waiting for you, Because im waiting for you
So wait for me, Darling wait
Wait for me
