Go And Sin No More Lyrics

By Rebecca St. James, Tedd T. & Michael Anderson

I've sinned come on my knees for I'm not worthy of Your love
How could you die for me such grace could only come from God
Oh Lord, You search and You know me You see me inside out
God, You alone can forgive me erase my fear and my doubt
Father, you pick me up - I feel like a child in Your arms
I don't deserve this love but, I hear Your voice Lord Jesus

Chorus:
Go & sin no more
He said "I will not condemn you, I'll forgive and I'll forget it all"
Go & sin no more 
"My child let me remind you it is I who'll lead and guide you as you go"

You are my purpose You are the reason that I live
I want to be like You Help me to love and to forgive
God let me not be distracted Lord help me focus on you
Keep sin from ruling my life, Lord make me holy and pure
Father you pick me up I feel like a child in Your arms
I don't deserve this love but, I hear Your voice Lord Jesus

Chorus

Wipe, wipe away
Take, take away
Break, break away
Fill my life, make it right, Father help me, Father help me GO

Chorus

He said "I will not condemn you, no"
Go & sin no more
"My child let me remind you it is I who'll lead and guide you as you GO"

I've sinned come on my knees how could You die for me
You search my heart know my thoughts
See me inside and out and all throughout me
You alone can forgive me
You always pick me up like a child in Your arms
I could stay with You forever here

Repeat
