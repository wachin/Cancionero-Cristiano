      Song: Lion Lyrics

      Mysterious
      That's what I call You
      I'm curious about You
      I'm scared and not sure that You are safe
      But Your eyes seem to say that You are good 

      Chorus
      This is not a dream that I'm living
      This is just a world of Your own
      You took me from all that I knew
      Shown me how it feels to hope 
      With You with me, facing tomorrow together 
      I can learn to fly
      Feels like I'm living in a lion's mouth, but the lion is (an angel)

      Wise eyes, You see the core of me
      Your gentleness melts me
      And now I know that words cannot describe
      The power that I feel when I'm with You

      Chorus
      This is not a dream that I'm living
      This is just a world of Your own
      You took me from all that I knew
      Shown me how it feels to hope 
      With You with me, facing tomorrow together 
      I can learn to fly
      Feels like I'm living in a lion's mouth, but the lion is

      Peace and power, love forever
      Who am I to stand before You?
      I am speechless
      But in my weakness
      You are here and all is well

      You took me from all that I knew
      Shown me how it feels to hope 
      With You with me, facing tomorrow together 
      I can learn to fly
      Feels like I'm living in a lion's mouth, but the lion is (an angel)

      Chorus
      This is not a dream that I'm living
      This is just a world of Your own
      You took me from all that I knew
      Shown me how it feels to hope 
      With You with me, facing tomorrow together 
      I can learn to fly
      Feels like I'm living in a lion's mouth, but the lion is (an angel) 

      is an angel
