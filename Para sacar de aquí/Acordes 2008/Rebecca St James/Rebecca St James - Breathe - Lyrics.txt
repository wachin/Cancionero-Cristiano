Breathe 
Enviado por: Rebecca St. James 

This is the air I breathe
This is the air I breathe
Your Holy Presence living in me

This is my daily bread
This is my daily bread
Your very Word spoken to me

CHORUS:
And I, I'm desperate for You
And I, I'm lost without You
I'm lost without You
I'm lost without You

This is the air I breathe
This is the air I breathe
Your Holy Presence living in me

CHORUS
