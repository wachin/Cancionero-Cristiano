Bm7                   G5            Bm7         G5        A         Bm7  
     I've sinned come on my knees-  for I'm not worthy    of your   love 
     You   are   my      purpose-         You are the reason      that  I    live 
Bm7                G5          Bm7              G5        A         Bm7  
     How could you die for me- such grace could only      come from God 
      I      want    to   be like You-   Help me to      love and to for- - - - - give  
Bm7                                        G5      
     Oh Lord, You search and you know me-  you see me inside out 
     God let me not be distracted-                    Lord help me focus on You 
Bm7                                       G5      
     God, you alone can forgive me-       erase my fear and my doubt 
     Keep sin from ruling my life, Lord- make me holy and pure 
Bm7                            G5      
     Father You pick me up-  I feel like a child in Your arms 
     Father You pick me up-  I feel like a child in Your arms 
Bm7                                   G5      
     I don't deserve this love but, I hear your voice Lord Jesus 
     I don't deserve this love but  I hear Your voice Lord Jesus
