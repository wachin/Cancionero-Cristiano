Verse 1:
       F             C               Dm    
Who am I, that the Lord of all the earth
        C              Bb
Would care to know my name
 Bb
Would care to feel my hurt

Verse 2:
       F             C                  Dm
Who am I, that the bright and morning stars
        C                  Bb
Would choose to light the way
 Bb
For my ever wandering heart
       Bb            C
Not because of who I am
       Dm                   C
But because of what You've done
      Dm                  C
Not because of what I've done
      Bb                C
But because of who You are

Chorus:
F        C              Dm
I am a flower quickly fading
       C               Bb
Here today and gone tomorrow
   C                   Bb
A wave tossed in the ocean
    C            F
A vapor in the wind
            C                 Dm
Still You hear me when I'm calling
            C                 Bb
Lord, You catch me when I'm falling
            C            Bb
And you've told me who I am
       F
I am Yours
