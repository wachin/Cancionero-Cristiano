CAPO III

VERSE 1:
Bm7       C2           D        G/B      C    G     
All---my days, I will sing this song of glad-ness.  
Bm7       C2       D       G/B      C
Give my praise the Fountain of   de-lights;
    Am7     Cmaj7       D               C      G/B   D
for in -------my ------helplessness you heard---my---cry,  
    Am7    Cmaj7      Bm7                             E
and waves---of--------mercy poured down on my life.

VERSE 2:
Bm7         C2          D        G/B     C    G
I---- will trust in the cross of my Re--deem--er; 
Bm7          C2         D           G/B       C
I----- will sing of the blood that nev--er fails, of 
Am7     Cmaj7      D          C     G/B      D
sins-----for------giv--en, of con--science cleansed, of 
Am7      Cmaj7     Bm7                                      E       
death----- de------fea---ted and---life with--out end.

CHORUS:
A         D       G           A      D               Em              Em/D
Beautiful Saviour, Wonderful Counsel-or, clothed in majesty, Lord of history, 
            A       Bm7       A                 D             G
You're the Way the Truth, the Life, Star of the Morning.
         A      D               Em                  Em/D
Glorious ho--liness, You're the Risen One, Heaven's Champion, 
        A     Bm7   A             Bm7         C2       D
and You reign, You reign, over all.

VERSE 3:
Bm7       C2             D         G/B   C     G
I long to be,  where the praise is never en---ding;
Bm7        C2             D    G/B     C
Yearn to dwell where the glory never  fades,
Am7     Cmaj7    D               C     G/B   D
Where count-less worshipers will share- one- song;
Am7  Cmaj7    Bm7                           E
And cries of "worthy" will honor the Lamb!
