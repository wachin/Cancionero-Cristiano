                           Gm                       Bb

F               Gm7         F            Eb(add9)
hurts to see my only friend slowly fade away

Lord you love him so you gave your only son if he would just believe he 
            Gm                   Bb                    F
would never die how then will he know if he has never heard Lord he has
