Verse 1:
Fsus             F               Dm               Dm7   
 Oh what i would do to have the kind of faith it takes to climb out of this 
Bb          Eb                Bb       Fsus        F                Dm
boat i'm in onto the crashing waves to step out of my comfort zone into the 
Dm7                        Bb                 Eb              Bb
realm of the unknown where Jesus is and he's holding out his hand but the 
C          Bb                          Fsus     F     C           Bb
waves are calling out my name and they laugh at me reminding me of all the 
           Fsus              F          C                 Bb          Bb    
times i've tried before and failed the waves they keep on telling me time 
     C      Dm          Bbsus           C2         F
and time again "boy you never win, you never win"

Chorus:
F                    C                          Dm                Bbsus
   But the voice of truth tells me a different story the voice of truth 
                     F                     C                         Dm
says "Do not be afraid" and the voice of truth says "This is for my glory" 
                       Bbsus           Dm                 Bbsus
out of all the voices calling out to me i will choose to listen and believe 
      Fsus      F
the voice of truth 

Verse 2:
Fsus             F               Dm               Dm7   
oh what i would do to have the kind of strength it takes to stand before a 
Bb                 Eb         Bb       Fsus            F             
giant with just a sling and a stone surrounded by the sound of a thousand 
Dm        Dm7              Bb                 Eb              
warriors shaking in their armor wishing they'd have had the strength to 
 Bb           C              Bb                  Fsus     F    C
stand but the giants calling out my name and he laughs at me reminding me 
    Bb            Fsus    F                    C                 Bb
of all times i've tried before and failed the giant keeps on telling me 
 Bb      C      Dm            Bbsus           C2                   F
time and time again "Boy, you never win, you never win"
