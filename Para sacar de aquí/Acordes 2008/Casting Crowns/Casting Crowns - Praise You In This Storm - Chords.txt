they are labled as fingered)

Piano Arranged For Guitar (This is not how it actually goes, but since this part is mostly lead by 

the piano, I went ahead and just sorta made somethin up to play on guitar when playin by yourself, 

you can pretty much just play around with dm, B, F, C with a 5th[G] on the top.)

Dm               Bb                             F
   I was sure by now God you would have reached down

               C5                         Dm
 and wiped our tears away, stepped in and saved the day.

         Bb              F                 C5
But once again, I say amen that it's still raining

Gm                        Bb5                                  F         C5

  as the thunder rolls, I barely hear your whisper through the rain, I'm with you

    Gm                    Bb5                                   F               C5      

and as your mercy falls I raise my hands and praise the God who gives and takes away.


Chorus:

D5                              Bb                        F

    And i'll praise you in this storm, and i will lift my hands

                     C5                     D5

that you are who you are, no matter where I am

                    Bb                     F

and every tear I've cried you hold in your hand

                  C5                          Gm        Bb

you never left my side and though my heart is torn

                          F

I will praise you in this storm

Dm           B5                     F

  I remember when I stumbled in the wind

             C5                   Dm
 
you heard my cry you raised me up again

                      B5                   F

my strength is almost gone how can I carry on

           C5 

if I can't find you



Gm                        Bb5                                  F         C5

  as the thunder rolls, I barely hear your whisper through the rain, I'm with you

    Gm                    Bb5                                   F               C5      

and as your mercy falls I raise my hands and praise the God who gives and takes away.


[Chorus]

Bridge:

D5                               Bb

   I lift my eyes unto the hills,  where does my help come from?

F                             C5

  My help comes from the Lord,   the maker of heaven and earth

D5                               Bb

   I lift my eyes unto the hills,  where does my help come from?

F                             C5                            D5  Bb   F   C5

  My help comes from the Lord,   the maker of heaven and earth


[Chorus]


                       Gm        Bb

and though my heart is torn

                          F         C5

I will praise you in this storm


D5  Bb   F   C5 (Repeat) 

End on D5
