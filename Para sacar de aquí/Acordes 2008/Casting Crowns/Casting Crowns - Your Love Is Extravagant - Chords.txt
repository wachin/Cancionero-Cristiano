Your Love Is Extravagant by Casting Crowns
Lyrics and music by Darrell Evans

Capo 2

D/F#     G   Bm   A	    D/F#     G  Bm  A
Your love              is extravagant
     D/F#     G   Bm   A       D/F#    G  Bm  A
Your friendship,         it is intimate
D/F#          G           Bm             A	       
I feel like moving to the rhythm of Your grace 
               D/F#      G            Bm      A 
Your fragrance is intoxicating in our secret place
D/F#     G   Bm   A	   D/F#     G  Bm  A
Your love             is extravagant

Chorus:
A                  Em       (D/F#)G 	                    A
Spread wide in the arms of Christ   is the love that covers sin
A                      Em  (D/F#)G		       A        
No greater love have I ever known  You considered me a friend
 		  D/F#
Capture my heart again
