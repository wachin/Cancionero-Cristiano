Song: The Best Thing 
Album: Oxygen 
[" Oxygen " CD] 

I've seen the world through jaded eyes
I've heard the silence in the still of the night 
I hid my heart, it broke in two
Oh I'd be nowhere if it wasn't for you
I heard your voice
You turned me around 
It's like I'm flying with my feet on the ground

Bridge: 
And you are the best thing that's happened to me
Now I know what I need my life to be

I felt a cool rain fall on me 
And I discovered how it feels to be free
I lived some days like a dream come true
I'd give it all for just a moment with you
I hear your voice 
I run to the sound
It's like I'm flying with my feet on the ground

Chorus:
And you are the best thing that's happened to me
Now I know what I need my life to be
You are the one thing that keeps me alive
Whatever happens I know I'll survive

And I know (And I know I'll see in eternity)
When all my tears fade away (They will fade away)
( And you will wipe the tears away from my eyes)
I will see 
( And I know I'll see in eternity)
The best thing I have ever seen
(You're the best thing)
(You're the best thing I have seen)

Yeah...
