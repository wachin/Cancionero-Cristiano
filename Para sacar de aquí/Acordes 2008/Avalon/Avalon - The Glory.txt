Song lyrics
In the solitary moment of His birth
On this barren dusty land
All of heaven kissed the face of the earth
With a miracle of love 
God became a man
But He was sent away to draw his final breath 
When he was only thirty-three
And in the shame of dying a criminal's death
He cleansed an angry world
And in his suffering I see

Chorus:
The glory of the blood
The beauty of the body
That was broken for our forgiveness
The glory of His perfect love
Is the heart of the story
The glory of the blood

I have tried to find salvation on my own
In a search for something real
There's a guilty heart inside this flesh and bone
I fall upon his grace 
And I begin to feel

Chorus:
The glory of the blood
The beauty of the body
That was broken for our forgiveness
The glory of His perfect love
Is the heart of the story
The glory of the blood

And when I close my eyes I can see Him 
hanging there
Oh the precious wounded Lamb of God
And all the majesty in this world can not compare 
to the glory
The beauty of the body
That was broken for our forgiveness

Chorus:
The glory of the blood
The beauty of the body
That was broken for our forgiveness
The glory of His perfect love
Is the heart of the story
The glory of the blood

He was sent away to draw His final breath 
When He was only thirty-three
