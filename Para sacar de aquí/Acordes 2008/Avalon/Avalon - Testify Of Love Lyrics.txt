INTRO: 

VERSE 1:
All the colors of the rainbow
All the voices of the wind
Every dream that reaches out
That reaches out to find where love begins       
Every word of every story
Every star in every sky
Every corner of creation lives to testify

CHORUS 1:
For as long as I shall live
I will testify to love
I'll be a witness in the silences when words are not enough
With every breath I take
I will give thanks to God above
For as long as I shall live
I will testify to love

VERSE 2:
>From the mountains to the valleys
>From the rivers to the sea
Every hand that reaches out
Every hand that reaches out to offer peace  (Hand of peace, oh)
Every simple act of mercy
Every step to Kingdom come
All the hope in every heart will speak what love has done
-CHORUS 1-
