Waiting For The World To Fall

by N/A
i'm afraid it's been too long to try to find the reasons why
i let my world close in around a smaller patch of fading sky
but now I've grown beyond the walls to where I've never been
and it's still winter in my wonderland

i'm waiting for the world to fall
i'm waiting for the scene to change
i'm waiting when the colors come 
i'm waiting to let my world come undone

i close my eyes and try to see the world unbroken underneath
the farther off and already it just might make the life I lead 
a little more than make-believe when all my skies are painted blue 
and the clouds don't ever change the shape of who I am to You

i'm waiting for the world to fall 
i'm waiting for the scene to change 
i'm waiting when the colors come 
i'm waiting to let my world come undone 

when I catch the light of falling stars my view is changing me 
my view is changing me

i'm waiting
