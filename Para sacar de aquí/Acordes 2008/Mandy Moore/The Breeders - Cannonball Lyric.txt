      Everytime somebody says to me,
      it's a secret, well I have to laugh
      'cause that is something I just can't keep
      it's a secret,


      Oh I've tried it once or twice
      but it didn't work too well
      so you'd better think it over
      'cause I'm gonna tell


      la-la-la-la-la-la-oh-oh
      I'll kiss and tell
      and everybodys' gonna know
      la-la-la-la-la-la-oh-oh
      I'll kiss and tell
      gotta let my feelings show


      'cause they tell me it's gotta be a secret thing
      it's no secret
      well, I've heard that before
      and there is always someone waiting in the wings
      it's no secret


      So if there's somebody else on your mind
      then it's not gonna work too well
      you would only be wasting your time
      'cause I'm gonna tell


      la-la-la-la-la-la-oh-oh
      I'll kiss and tell
      and everybodys' gonna know
      la-la-la-la-la-la-oh-oh
      I'll kiss and tell
      gotta let my feelings show


      Well, I'm not gonna get down to it
      until ya' make your mind up
      so make your mind up,
      mind up,
      mi...nd up, call me up
      'cause I want to kiss and tell


      if there's somebody else on your mind
      then it's not gonna work too well
      you would only be wasting your time
      'cause I'm gonna tell


      la-la-la-la-la-la-oh-oh
      I'll kiss and tell
      and everybodys' gonna know
      la-la-la-la-la-la-oh-oh
      I'll kiss and tell
      gotta let my feelings show


      Well, I'm not gonna get down to it
      until ya' make your mind up
      so make your mind up,
      mind up,
      mi...nd up, call me up
      'cause I want to kiss and tell


      la-la-la-la-la-la-oh-oh
      I'll kiss and tell
      and everybodys' gonna know
      la-la-la-la-la-la-oh-oh
      I'll kiss and tell
      gotta let my feelings show
