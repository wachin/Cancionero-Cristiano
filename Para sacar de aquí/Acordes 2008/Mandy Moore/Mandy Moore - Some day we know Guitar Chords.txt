A1:
 Asus2/F#      UC(I)
Ninety miles outside Chicago
 Asus2/F#             Asus2/E
Can't stop driving, I don't know why
 Asus2/F#             UC(I)
So many questions... I Need an answer
 Asus2/E                UC(II)      
Two years later, you're still on my mind
 
A2:
 Asus2/F#             UC(I)
Whatever happened to Amelia Earheart?
 Asus2/F#            Asus/E
Who hold the stars up in the sky?
 Asus2/F#                      Asus/E   Asus2/F#--             
Is true love just once in a lifetime?
      Asus/E                   B5th/E
Did the captain of the Titanic cry?

CH1:
 Asus2/F#
Someday we'll know
   Asus2/E
If love can move a mountain
 UC(I)
Someday we'll know
 UC(II)
Why the sky is blue
      Asus2/F#
Someday we'll know
 UC(II)                    B5th/E
Why I wasn't meant for you...

Does anybody know the way to Atlantis?
Or what the wind says when she cries?
I'm speeding by the place where I met you
For the ninety-seventh time... Tonight

CH2:
[the same as above CH1]
Someday we'll know
If love can move a mountain
Someday we'll know
Why the sky is blue
Someday we'll know
Why I wasn't meant for you...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[the same as above CH1]
Someday we'll know
Why Samson loved Delilah
One day I'll go
Dancing on the moon
Someday we'll know
That I was the one for you...

 
[the same as A2]
I bought a ticket to the end of the rainbow
Watched the stars crash in the sea
If I could ask God just one question
Why aren't you here with me?
