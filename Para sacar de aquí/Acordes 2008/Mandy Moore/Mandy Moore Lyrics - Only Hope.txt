      Song: Only Hope Lyrics
      There's a song that's inside of my soul
      It's the one that I've tried to write
      over and over again
      I'm awake in the infinite cold
      But you sing to me over and over and over again

      So I lay my head back down
      And I lift my hands
      And pray to be only yours
      I pray to be only yours
      I know now you're my only hope

      Sing to me the song of the stars
      Of your galaxy dancing and laughing
      and laughing again
      When it feels like my dreams are so far
      Sing to me of the plans that you have
      for me over again

      So I lay my head back down
      And I lift my hands
      And pray to be only yours
      I pray to be only yours
      I know now you're my only hope

      I give you my destiny
      I'm giving you all of me
      I want your symphony
      Singing in all that I am
      At the top of my lungs I'm giving it back 

      So I lay my head back down
      And I lift my hands
      And pray to be only yours 
      I pray to be only yours
      I pray to be only yours
      I know now you're my only hope
