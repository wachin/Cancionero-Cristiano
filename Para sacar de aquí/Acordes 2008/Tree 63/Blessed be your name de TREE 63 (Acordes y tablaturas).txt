VERSE 1: 
A          E                 F#m         D 
 Blessed be Your name in the land that is plentiful 
                 A                 E 
Where Your streams of abundance flow 
D 
Blessed be Your name 
A                  E                   F#m                       D 
 And blessed be Your name when I'm found in the desert place 
         A                E 
Though I walk through the wilderness 
       D 
Blessed be Your name 
  
PRE-Chorus: 
A               E     
 Every blessing You pour out I'll 
F#m         D 
 turn back to praise 
A                     E 
 And when the darkness closes in, Lord 
F#m          D 
 Still I will say 
  
Chorus: 
               A                E 
Blessed be the name of the Lord 
                F#m   D 
Blessed be Your name 
               A                E 
Blessed be the name of the Lord 
                F#m     D 
Blessed be Your glorious name 
  
VERSE 2: 

Blessed be Your name when the sun's shining down on me 

When the world's "all as it should be" 

Blessed be Your name 

And blessed be Your name on the road marked with suffering 

Though there's pain in the offering 

Blessed be Your name 
  
BRIDGE: 
    A              E 
You give and take away 
    F#m           D 
You give and take away 
   A                    E 
My heart will choose to say 
      F#m            D       
Lord, blessed be Your name
