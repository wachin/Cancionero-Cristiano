      Artist: Nichole Nordeman Lyrics
      Song: I Will Believe Lyrics

      We were meant to open doors
      And we were meant to face the danger
      Never knowing what's in store
      And never having met a stranger

      One of us is big and brave
      And one of us is tenderhearted
      One of us is tempting fate
      And the last but not least of us
      Has faith enough for each of us

      And I know
      That I could never go it alone
      'Cause I believe
      I'd be lost without You here beside me

      Chorus
      It's like daylight
      At midnight
      It's my favorite dream when nothings really as it seems
      Don't wake me
      Just take me
      Take me by the hand and I will believe

      We have always been protected
      Little ones should run and hide
      But we expect the unexpected
      When love arrives and calls us all inside

      And I know
      That even when the wind blows
      I'll be fine
      'Cause You and I will get by 'til Springtime

      Chorus
      It's like daylight
      At midnight
      It's my favorite dream when nothings really as it seems
      Don't wake me
      Just take me
      Take me by the hand and I will believe

      Don't close your eyes, I'm right beside you
      Don't be afraid, I'm never far
      You and I were always meant to
      Wake the dreamers from the dark
      Come out, come out wherever you are

      Chorus
      It's like daylight
      At midnight
      It's my favorite dream when nothings really as it seems
      Don't wake me
      Just take me
      Take me by the hand and I will believe

      Come out, come out wherever you are
