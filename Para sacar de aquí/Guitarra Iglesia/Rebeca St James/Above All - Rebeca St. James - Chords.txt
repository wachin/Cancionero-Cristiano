          A     B            E
Above all powers, Above all Kings
          A     B                  E
Above all nature, and all created things
          C#m         B               A    E
Above all wisdom, and all the ways of man 
F#m            A               B
You were here before the world began

A       B            E
Above all kingdoms, Above all thrones
          A            B              E
Above all wonders this world has ever known
          C#m        B                A    E
Above all wealth and treasures of the earth
F#m               A                   G#maj
There's no way to measure what you're worth

C#m    A   B             E
Crucified, laid behind a stone
C#m    A   B                   E               
You lived to die, rejected and alone
C#m          B               F#maj
Like a rose, trampled on the ground
              A                   B
You took the fall, and thought of me 
       E
Above all
