I am not skilled to understand
                                  Bm7
What God has willed, what God has planned
                         A

                      D
Stands one who is my Savior

Christ died to save me; this I read
                         A

And come for sinful man to die
                                  A
You count it strange, so once did I
                   D
Before I knew my Savior
