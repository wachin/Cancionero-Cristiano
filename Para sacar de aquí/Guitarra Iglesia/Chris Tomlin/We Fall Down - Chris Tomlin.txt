[Verse 1]
D                 A       Bm          
We fall down, we lay our crown
G       D A
at the feet of Jesus
D                     A         Bm     The greatness of His mercy and love
G       D A
at the feet of Jesus

[Chorus]
D         G        D A
We cry Holy, Holy, Holy
D         G        D A
We cry Holy, Holy, Holy
D         G        D A  G   A    D
We cry Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lamb

[Verse 2]
No more fears, You've dried our tears
at the feet of Jesus
Grace abounds to all who've found
the feet of Jesus

[Chorus]
D         G        D A
We cry Holy, Holy, Holy
D         G        D A
We cry Holy, Holy, Holy
D         G        D A  G   A    D
We cry Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lamb
